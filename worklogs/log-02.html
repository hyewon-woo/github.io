    <h1>Log 02 — Refined Project Proposal</h1>
    <p><em>Date:</em> Feb 15, 2026</p>

    <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
    <p>This project is continuition of my own project "readYou" from application development course at Whitworth University.
    readYou is a journaling web application designed to encourage users to journal regularly to allow daily reflection time for mental health.
    Current version of readYou allows user to submit journal, and recieve suggested music & coloring sheets from implemented APIs.
    However, current version of readYou faces NLP challenges. It is unable to recognize sarcasm, dialectal or cultural expressions.
    Followed by its challenges with NLP, it is not able to provide fully personalized activity suggestions.</p>
    
    <P>Through this Project "readYou ver.2", I am intending to upgrade readYou more user friendly, user understanding, and user helpful application. 
    I am looking into creating mobile app version of readYou for better accessibility for users to take journal whenever and wherever.
    I am also hoping to intergrate NLP that is awware of sarcasm, dialects and cultural expressions to analyze journals better in order to provide fully personalized suggestions.
    In order to do so, Journal storage is the first thing to be nailed down, as long as frame work to develop mobile app for it.</P>

    <p>I am planning on using either Swift or Flutter to develop mobile app for readYou ver.2. To get expert's feedback, I Will be reaching out to Sarah Immel and Caterina Moruzzi from University of Edinburgh.
    Furthermore, I will be inputting my own journals on regular basis to develop a small case study using real user data.</p>

    <h3>key functions</h3>
    emotional recognition and key word detection 

    <h3>Deliverables to be figured out</h3>
    - Secure storage of journal: json
    - NLP framework/module to analyze the user journal 
    - Search engine filters to suggest activites based on key words extracted from journal. 

    <h3>Area Experts</h3>
    I will be contacting Sarah Immel, and Dr. Caterina Morouzzi via email at the beginning of the project, middle of the project, and right before finalizing the project, total 3 times to get feedbacks from area expert. 

    <h3>Tentative Project Timeline</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Febraruy 15th-21st Data Elicitation: Collect data needed to start the project, including college students in US mental well being, beneefit of journaling, and NLP module to be used for project.</li>
      <li>Feburary 21st-28th Data Analysis: Start analyzing data and come up with an efficient structure of readYou. Gather feedback from Scott, and at least 2 other fellow classmates.</li>
      <li>March 1st-3rd Framework Sketch and Wireframe</li>
      <li>March 3rd-13th Prototyping, 1st iteration: Start coding the project, gather user feedback</li>
      <li>March 14th-April 6th 2nd iteration: start developing readYou to be more user focused.</li>
      <li>April 6th-May 1st: Finish up the application, and start drafting the paper</li>
      <li>May 1st-May10th: Refinement of artifacts/deliverables, prepare to present.</li>
      
    </ul>
    <h2>What did I accomplish</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Refined my github webstie</li>
      <li>Refined project proposal</li>
      <li>Contacted area experts in order to get feedback</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What did I learn | What did I struggle with</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It took me awhile to establish what I want this project to be. I reached out to couple of fellow classmates, and emailed area experts to get suggested future direction with this project. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>CSS styling for worklogs and products page.</li>
      <li>Start on phase 1 of Data collection for the project. </li>
     
    </ul>
